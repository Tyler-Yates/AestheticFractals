<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Fractals are defined as “a curve or geometric figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the
    whole." They have been researched extensively, due in large part to the complex results that can arise from
    iterating
    over simple processes many times, and fractals have been found to model a wide range of natural phenomena. Each
    fractal
    family is defined by a basic mathematical structure, from which variations are created by altering the coefficients
    of
    the basic equation. Because these coefficients can be represented by floating point numbers, determining a genome
    for
    the fractals is potentially simple and can lead to computationally light mutations, through slight alteration of the
    coefficients, and crossovers, through an averaging of the parent’s coefficients. It is also possible to expand upon
    the
    process of generating offspring fractals by taking outside factors into account, and entire families can be
    generated
    programmatically through evolution of the equations themselves, creating potentially complex fractal patterns tended
    towards certain desirable features.</p>

<h2>The Program</h2>
    The Aesthetic Fractals Program allows users to evolve fractals to their liking using genetic programming. The
    program
    runs on Linux and uses the OpenGL framework for its graphics.

    <h2>How to Git It</h2>
    The program is hosted on Github <p></p>
    Clone the project onto your machine:
    <div class="code">
        git clone https://github.com/Tyler-Yates/AestheticFractals.git<br>
        cd AestheticFractals
    </div>
    <p></p>
    Install the necessary dependencies:
    <div class="code">sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglew-dev libpng-dev g++</div>
    <p></p>
    Build the dependencies:
    <div class="code">
	git submodule init<br>
	git submodule update<br>
        make -C C-Genetics/libs/AntTweakBar/src<br>
        make -C C-Genetics
    </div>
    <p></p>
    Compile the program:
    <div class="code">
        mvn install
    </div>
    <p></p>
    Run the program:
    <div class="code">
        mvn exec:java
    </div>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Left-click on a fractal's box in the window to select that fractal as a parent for the next generation. Press space
    when you have
    finished picking parents to generate the next generation. Press left and right to go through the history of the
    generated fractals. Right-click on a fractal to render it.
